# Background

Harrison Publishing House (HPH) is a content and software provider to the construction industry in North America.  We aggregate building product information, extend the data with our own content, and make it available to trade participants.

HPH has historically supported mechanical contractor estimating systems with price updates so that estimators could use current information when preparing bids.
  
With our new product CINX (Construction Information Network & Exchange) we are expanding our software offering for both contractors and wholesale distributors (vendors) from whom contractors purchase materials.  For contractors CINX will provide a Master Data Management platform and transaction integration with their vendors.  For wholesale distributors CINX will provide a standardized customer integration portal and limited CRM functionality.
