# Project Items

## Project Items Definition
### CINX Object Definition - Project Items

CINX Project Items are building material products or construction related services that are used on a project.

A CINX project item is linked to its source item in a CINX Catalog. Note: If a project is imported into CINX and its items are not yet linked to a catalog item a new catalog item will be created.

In addition to the catalog-level information, a project item has a large number of fields that can used to manage the item through the different project and procurement workflows. Some important examples include: project job-costing, taxes, order conditions, construction status, work-breakdowns, and ERP integration.  

Project items are also tracked on every transaction to which they have been attached.

**Dependencies and Business Rules**

  - A project item must be associated with a CINX project
  - A project item must be associated with a CINX catalog item
  - A project item must have a quantity

**Supported API Services**
